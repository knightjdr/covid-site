In BioID, a protein of interest is fused with an\n      {' '}\n      <span className=\"resources__bioid-species\">\n        E. coli\n      </span>\n      {' '}\n      biotin conjugating enzyme mutant. The abortive mutant BirA* protein (R118G) can efficiently activate biotin,\n      but exhibits a reduced affinity for the activated molecule. Highly reactive biotinoyl-AMP thus simply\n      diffuses away from BirA* and forms covalent bonds with nearby amine groups - including epsilon amines\n      on lysine residues in neighbouring (within ~10nm) polypeptides. Following cell lysis, these\n      biotinylated proteins can be affinity purified using streptavidin and identified with MS. Since\n      interactors are covalently modified with biotin, highly robust lysis conditions can be used to\n      solubilize polypeptides from less soluble cellular compartments. Finally, unlike IP-based approaches,\n      BioID does not require that protein-protein interactions be maintained post-lysis. Weak and/or transient\n      interactors can thus also be identified with this technique.\n    </p>\n    <h4>References</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <Link to=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1367593118301327?via%3Dihub\">\n          Getting to know the neighborhood: using proximity-dependent biotinylation to characterize\n          protein complexes and map organelles\n        </Link>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <Link to=\"https://www.mcponline.org/content/19/5/757.long\">\n          Proximity Dependent Biotinylation: Key Enzymes and Adaptation to Proteomics Approaches\n        </Link>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default ResourcesPage;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
