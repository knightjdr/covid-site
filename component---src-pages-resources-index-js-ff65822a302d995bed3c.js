The abortive mutant BirA* protein (R118G) can efficiently activate biotin, but exhibits a reduced affinity for the activated molecule. Highly reactive biotinoyl-AMP thus simply diffuses away from BirA* and forms covalent bonds with nearby amine groups - including epsilon amines on lysine residues in neighbouring (within ~10nm) polypeptides. Following cell lysis, these biotinylated proteins can be affinity purified using streptavidin and identified with MS. Since interactors are covalently modified with biotin, highly robust lysis conditions can be used to solubilize polypeptides from less soluble cellular compartments.
